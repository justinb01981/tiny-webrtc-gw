# webRTC videoconference-in-a-box (C monolith)

## tiny-webrtc-gw: a webRTC conferencing server "monolith" written in C/C++
Welcome to the tiny-webrtc-gw readme!


## Goals
* Infinite &#x231A; duration streams     (security &#x1F4F9; friendly)
* private rooms
* 1-click-join [links](https://wintermute.nonroutable.net/content/index_broadcast.html?joinroom=lobby&camera=0)
* VP8,VP9,H.264
* very fast stream multiplexing via lightweight C
* NO cloud or external STUN/TURN involved ergo: raspberry-pi + airgapped LAN
* SD/HD bitrates 
* High-performance: ~68Mbit/sec per stream+thread on an 800Mhz ARM7
* friendly chatroom-style UX (e.g. justin.tv)

## Features
* Very low latency 1-many streaming
* HD stream (via media constraints) support
* text chat room
* highly scalable (native c/c++ code)
* end-to-end encrypted
* chrome/firefox/opera/safari (iOS) support
* easy compilation (just git checkout --recursive and "make all")
* select media devices
* code includes submodule referencing the standalone HTTPS server + example certificate

## Demo:
  [&#128247;chat lobby on a raspi4;](https://wintermute.nonroutable.net/content/index_broadcast.html?joinroom=lobby)

## Caveats:
  since browsers won't allow webRTC to be negotiated unencrypted (https)
  you will need to run an SSL frontend in front of the built-in
  http server (see config.txt for that port)
  lots of better built-ins exist but I use a tool I wrote as a proxy
  [https://github.com/justinb01981/SSLTools]
  (maybe just use a (free) self-signed certificate
  generated by openssl(2) for now and import it into the conferencee's
  browser/OS certificate trust-store)

## Building:

building requires 'go' to compile boringssl (so install those packages)

*OUTDATED?*
Make sure you checked out the websocket git submodule by checking out
with --recurse-submodules or doing
git submodule init xxx && git submodule update xxx
(for both ws and SSLTools I think)

from the base directory just run 'make all'.

~~You will need to edit at least one line in config.txt so the built-in STUN
server knows its own IP address (relative to the clients connecting, if
you're using NAT). Go to whatismyipaddress.com and replace the
udpserver_addr=x.x.x.x line with your own IP address. I recommend config
uring the port for 3478 because technically we are using the port for STUN/ICE
AND for RTP.~~

## Etc:
  * 8/15 - NO SETUP necessary (beyond making ports accessible) - this is possible with the new stun_client.c code - but in airgapped networks config.txt still nec.
  * 9/14 - OBS-direct (no browser) streaming support coming - see https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-cracks-the-whip-on-obs/
  * constructing a share URL: 
  ```
  <your_https_prefix>/content/index_broadcast.html?joinroom=<roomname>&camera=0
  ```
  --- e.g. https://tinyurl.com/jbhatestypingthis
  ```
  (drops a user in "lobby" with camera disabled)
  ```
