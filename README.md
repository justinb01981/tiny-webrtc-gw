# tiny-webrtc-gw
Welcome to the tiny-webrtc-gw readme!

tiny-webrtc-gw: a webRTC conferencing server "monolith" written in C/C++
or:
webRTC video/audio conferencing (many-to-many) server daemon for linux


__The simplest way to roll-your-own (secure) webRTC video broadcast service.__

Goals:
* very fast stream multiplexing via lightweight C
* no external servers required - run it on a raspberry-pi on an
  air-gapped network
  if youre into that sort of thing
* HD (getUserMedia constraints up-to+beyond 1080p) support
* global conference/user/conversation chatroom navigation

Caveats:
  since webRTC refuses to happen unless https is involved/trusted
  you will need to run an SSL frontend in front of the built-in
  http server (see config.txt for that port)
  lots of better built-ins exist but I use a tool I wrote as a proxy
  [https://github.com/justinb01981/SSLTools]
  (maybe just use a (free) self-signed certificate
  generated by openssl(2) for now and import it into the conferencee's
  browser/OS certificate trust-store)

Hot features:
* Very low latency 1-many streaming
* HD stream support
* text chat room
* highly scalable (native c/c++ code)
* end-to-end encrypted
* chrome/firefox/opera/safari (iOS) support
* easy compilation (just git checkout --recursive and "make all")
* select media devices

Building:

building requires 'go' to compile boringssl (so install those packages)

*OUTDATED?*
Make sure you checked out the websocket git submodule by checking out
with --recursive or doing
git submodule init ws && git submodule update ws

from the base directory just run 'make all'.

You will need to edit at least one line in config.txt so the built-in STUN
server knows its own IP address (relative to the clients connecting, if
you're using NAT). Go to whatismyipaddress.com and replace the
udpserver_addr=x.x.x.x line with your own IP address. I recommend config
uring the port for 3478 because technically we are using the port for STUN/ICE
AND for RTP.
